Playing Cards
=============

HTML and CSS playing cards.

This began as an experiment inspired by Buffalo Wild Wings' poker challenge. Their playing card design was unique, and I found myself starting to think about how best I could mimic that design in CSS. Not long after that, I had four unique styles and a simple JavaScript switcher to toggle between them.
